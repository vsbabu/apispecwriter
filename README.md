# apispecwriter

It is much easier to write API Specs in IDEs with nice language like Kotlin, rather than hand-crafting OpenAPI json.

This is a template repository for such projects.

`mvn spring-boot:run` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

See `Order.kt` for a sample controller and object used.
